# odin-recipies

**Foundation Course - Project: Recipes**

In this project I will be building a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipies. 

This website will not have any CSS for now, however it will be revisited in the future and developed further to incude some visual design elements.

This initial setup has demonstrated my ability to use GitHub and the commandline together to navigate git.

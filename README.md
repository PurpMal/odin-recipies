# odin-recipies

**Foundation Course - Project: Recipes**

In this project I will be building a basic recipe website. It will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipies.

This website will not have any CSS for now, however it will be revisited in the future and developed further to incude some visual design elements.

This initial setup has demonstrated my ability to use GitHub and the command line together.

Further work has shown my ability to build a very basic site, linking pages, linking images from across the web, building lists, and adding a back to index button!

Created and linked a CSS stylesheet, added more complicated CSS stylings to make the recipe page look more appealing, futher work is required to make it exactly how I want it.
